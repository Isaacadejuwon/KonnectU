Instructions for Your Frontend Developer

1. API URL: This is the single, public base URL for all API calls: https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com

2. Local Setup: In your frontend project's .env.local (or equivalent) file, set your API base URL to this public address:


# Example for a React app
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com
When you run your local frontend (npm run start), it will make its API calls directly to the live, deployed backend.

3. API Documentation (Swagger UI): The interactive API documentation is now live. You can access it in your browser at: https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com/api

4. Authentication Flow (Important): You will be able to see the Swagger UI, but to use the "Try it out" buttons, you must get an application token.

Use an API client (like Postman) to call the login endpoint: POST https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com/auth/login (Include a test user's email/password in the body).

The API will respond with an access_token (a JWT).

Copy this token.

In the Swagger UI, click the "Authorize" button, paste the token into the Bearer field, and save.

You can now use all the "Try it out" buttons.

Instructions for Your Backend Developer
Your workflow is split into building new features (local) and testing the deployed service (live).

1. Building New Features (Local Dev) This workflow does not change.

Run the app locally: npm run start:dev

This uses your local .env file and your local/dev database.

Test your new code by visiting your local Swagger UI: http://localhost:4000/api

2. Testing the Deployed Service (Live) This is now much easier. You do not need the gcloud proxy.

API URL: https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com

Live Docs: Just open https://dev.api.konnectusolutions.com/api in your browser.

Postman: Use the public URL directly.

Call POST /auth/login to get an application JWT.

Use that JWT as a Bearer Token for all other locked endpoints.

3. Viewing Live Logs (Your Only GCP Task) This is the only task that still requires Google Cloud access.

Log in: Make sure you have run gcloud auth login (if you haven't already).

View Logs: You have been given Logs Viewer permission. You can view all backend logs at this URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?project=konnectu-app&resource=cloud_run_revision
